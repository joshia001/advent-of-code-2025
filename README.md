# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2025 - an annual programming challenge consisting of daily puzzles.

The puzzle scenarios and input files are not included in this repository and can be accessed at https://adventofcode.com/ .

Each solution is written in Python for the purposes of practicing my overall proficiency, especially in topics such as:
- Arrays & strings
- Hash maps & sets
- Trees & graphs
- File parsing
- Code efficiency (time/space complexity)
- Code structure, modularity and readability
